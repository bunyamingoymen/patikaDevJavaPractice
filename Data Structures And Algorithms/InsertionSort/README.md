# InsertionSort

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

1. Show the steps of sorting the array above:
    
    -> [22,27,16,2,18,6]
    
    -> [2,27,16,22,18,6]
    
    -> [2,6,16,22,18,27]
    
    -> [2,6,16,18,22,27]
    
2. Big-O notation:

    -> O(n^2)

3. Write three cases below

      Average case: 16,18
      
      Worst case: 22,27
      
      Best case: 2,6
      
4. What case is correct for the number 18 after the array is sorted?

    Average case


-> Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort.

--> [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6]

--> [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15.6]

--> [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15.6]

--> [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15.6]

--> [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15.7]

--> [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,15.9]

--> [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.15]
